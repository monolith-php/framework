# Monolith PHP Web Development Framework

**version: $$VERSION$$**

This is in-development and is not likely to be ever prepared for mass consumption.

That said, to install:

1. extract [the application skeleton](https://github.com/monolith-php/application-skeleton/archive/master.zip) to a new folder
2. run composer install
