# Monolith PHP Web Development Framework

**version: $$VERSION$$**

This is in-development and is not likely to be ever prepared for mass consumption.

## Goals

1. idiomatic language usage
    1. allows static-analysis without IDE extension or helpers
2. no compromise for tradition
    1. discovery is part of the process
    2. integration of established tools / standards generally avoided
3. grown like a garden
    1. naive implementations are designed first
    2. algorithms become more complex only when pain points are experienced
    3. solve problems with the simplest implementation possible
4. can become feature-complete
    1. lack of ambition to solve all problems
    2. components are open for extension, closed for modification   

## Installation

1. extract [the application skeleton](https://github.com/monolith-php/application-skeleton/archive/master.zip) to a new folder
2. run composer install
